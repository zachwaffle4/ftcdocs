Computer Vision Overview
========================

Introduction
------------

The *FIRST* Tech Challenge control system software has built-in support for two
computer vision technologies:

1.AprilTags -
   :doc:`AprilTags <../../../apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro>`
   are fiducial markers similar in design to a QR code that can be used
   for identification and localization. AprilTags are used as reference 
   points for autonomous navigation and for assisted navigation and
   identification of points of interest on a game field.

   -  Each season, FIRST provides 2D image targets that can be used as
      navigational reference points.
   -  If the AprilTag system recognizes an AprilTag image, it provides 
      very accurate pose information (assuming the camera used has 
      calibration parameters for the working resolution) about the 
      robotâ€™s position relative to the target.
   -  A robot can use this information to navigate autonomously on the
      field.
2. Color Processing - :doc:`Color Processing <../../../color_processing/index>`
   uses the OpenCV library that is built in to the FTC SDK to locate regions
   of certain colors or determine the color of a certain region. This can be
   useful for finding game elements on the field based on color, or
   determining if a game element belongs to your alliance.

AprilTag Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Very efficient with a fast detection rate (estimated 15 to 20
   detections per second, depending on decimation and target size).
-  Provides accurate, relative pose information of camera to target 
   in field coordinates.
-  Is less prone to fluctuating or varied lighting conditions on 
   the field.

   AprilTag can provide accurate pose information to target


AprilTag Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The entire AprilTag must be in the camera view in order to be 
   recognized, any occlusions render the object unprocessable.
-  AprilTags must be included in the tag library in order to 
   process pose information for the tag (tag size and value must
   be known to the AprilTag system in advance).
-  Cameras require calibration data for every resolution used 
   in order to process correct pose information.
